# AI-Search-Agents
Mini AI project for Search Agents @ Johns Hopkins Univ
Instructor: Musad Haque, PhD

- In this project, search agents are implemented.

- More specifically:

- Implement breadth-first search algorithm.
- Implement depth-first algorithm (optional).
- Implement Uniform-cost search algorithm (optional).
- Apply these algorithms to find a path on a map between two points.
